# DesiGauTech – Reviving the Indian Cow Breed for a Sustainable Future

🚀 **Live Demo**: [https://desigautech.onrender.com/](https://desigautech.onrender.com/)  

## 🐄 Problem Statement 

The Indian cow, once central to sustainable living, is currently facing a decline in both population and genetic quality. Urbanization, industrialization, and reduced awareness of the cow's cultural, environmental, and economic importance have contributed to this crisis. Traditional practices such as organic farming, Ayurvedic treatments, and bioenergy generation—heavily reliant on native cow breeds—are also diminishing.

There is a critical need for:
- Awareness generation
- Scientific breeding programs
- Farmer training and empowerment
- Conservation of indigenous breeds

## 🎯 Objective

Develop innovative, scalable, and sustainable solutions that:
- Conserve and improve Indian cow breeds
- Promote socio-economic and ecological benefits
- Align with the **Kamdhenu Program** for rural development and indigenous breed preservation
